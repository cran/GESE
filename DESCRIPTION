Description: Implements the gene-based segregation test(GESE) and the weighted GESE test for identifying genes with causal variants of large effects for family-based sequencing data. The methods are described in Qiao, D. Lange, C., Laird, N.M., Won, S., Hersh, C.P., et al. (2017). <DOI:10.1002/gepi.22037>. Gene-based segregation method for identifying rare variants for family-based sequencing studies. Genet Epidemiol 41(4):309-319. More details can be found at <http://scholar.harvard.edu/dqiao/gese>.
